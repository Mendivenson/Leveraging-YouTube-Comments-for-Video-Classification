# Workshops

This folder contains all the workshops developed as part of the *Statistical Network Analysis* course. The primary goal of these workshops is to familiarize students with the functions of the `igraph` package, enabling me to effectively apply these tools in my project.

1. [Network data handle and visualization](https://rpubs.com/Mendivenson/ARS1): This workshop covers the essentials of working with network data, including how to import, manipulate, and visualize networks using `igraph`. By the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of the basic operations needed to work with network data in `R` as well as some basic concepts of graph theory.
