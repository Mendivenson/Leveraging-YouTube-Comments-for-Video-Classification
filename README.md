# Leveraging YouTube comments for video classification

This project aims to classify YouTube videos into their predefined categories using a network analysis approach based on user comments. YouTube videos are often categorized into groups such as Music, Gaming, Education, and more, but these categories are typically assigned manually or based on metadata, which may be inaccurate or incomplete.

In this project, we explore the use of network analysis techniques, as covered in the Social Network Analysis course at the National University of Colombia, taught by Professor Juan Sosa, to understand the relationships between video content and user engagement, specifically focusing on the analysis of user comments.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a system that can automatically predict video categories based on the structure and content of the comment network, offering a more scalable and potentially more accurate method for video categorization than traditional metadata-based approaches.
